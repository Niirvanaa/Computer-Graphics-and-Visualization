# Computer-Graphics-and-Visualization
This project focused on creating an interactive 3D environment using computer graphics best practices. I learned how to render and transform 3D objects, control a virtual camera, and handle user input to allow smooth navigation throughout the scene.

I start designing software by undcerstanding and breaking into smaller pieces what is required. I can sketch ideas,plan object interations and thimk about usability and efficiency. Working on muy project helped me imporve modular design , adaptability and problem soling, which i can apply in future projects.

When developinh programs I break task into small steps,code incrementally, and test pften. For my 3D scene , I used libraries , experiemented with textures and camera controls.

CS helps me solve problems, code efficiently and build software. Computare Graphics taught me 3D modeling,spatial reasoning and visualization, which are useful for the future and school projects.
